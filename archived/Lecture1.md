# Types and Variables





- Programming is manipulating and interpreting data

- Data comes in different shapes and sizes, forming
  different *datatypes*

- An instance of a *datatype* is stored in a *variable*

## `sizeof` Operator

- The only difference between datatypes is their *size*

- We can get the size with the `sizeof` operator

```cpp
std::cout << sizeof(int) << std::endl;
std::cout << sizeof(char) << std::endl;
```

- There is code above^

## Primitive Types

#### Something about an `int`

### `char` Type

### `bool` Type

### `float` Type

### `void` Type
